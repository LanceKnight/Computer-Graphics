By default, the program will be compiled in debug mode, which will output a lot of debugging info. If you want to turn it off, remove the <-DDEBUG> from the following variable in the <Makefile> file
 
CFLAGS = -DDEBUG -g -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -fexpensive-optimizations -D_REENTRANT

Also, the maxium allowed nested read is 6. To change this setting, change the variable <numNested> in main.cpp somewhere below #include

some dummy testing commands:
{
move 123 // since the # of params are less than 3, it will fill 2nd and 3rd params with 0

MoVE 3,3	4 // it should accept MoVE the same as move. Delimiter like comma, space, tab should all be accepted.

move 2,3,3,1 // it will tell you that you have more than required parameters and abandon the command.

	// a deliberate empty command is a testing case

Read test.text // this should read in the test.txt, which contains most testing cases.It also demostrates its prevention of too many nested reads

read // this should tell you that file is not specified

read nonExistFile.txt // this should tell you that it is not able to open the file

read file1 file2 // this should tell you that it is more than allowed number of parameters
}
