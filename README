By default, the program will be compiled in debug mode, which will output a lot of debugging info. If you want to turn it off, remove the <-DDEBUG> from the following variable in the <Makefile> file
 
CFLAGS = -DDEBUG -g -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -fexpensive-optimizations -D_REENTRANT

Also, the maxium allowed nested read is 6. To change this setting, change the variable <numNested> in main.cpp somewhere below #include

you can execute:

read 1.txt 
read 2.txt
read 3.txt

for testing of TiffWrite, TiffStat, TiffRead respectively
